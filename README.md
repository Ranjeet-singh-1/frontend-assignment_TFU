# Front-end intern assignment for [The future University](https://www.thefuture.university)

I created a simple todo list in React.js, where the user can `add`, `delete`, and `mark` the todo item.

The app consists of multiple reusable components which are combined to make the final UI.


## React components created are:

- __Button.jsx__
    Button will have two variants which are `big` and `small`

- __Checkbox.jsx__
    Checkbox will have a checkbox input and a label. The label should be passed from props.

- __TodoRow.jsx__
    This will contain the `Checkbox` and `Button` component. The button should only be visible on hover.

## Learning in this assignments are:

- learn more about props like `props destructing`
  - Passing functions as props

- learn hooks
  - How to handle state variable and change it using state function
  - state variable can be `array` , `object` or any `value`
- adding event listners
- adding event handlers
