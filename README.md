The app consists of multiple reusable components which are combined to make the final UI.

## Requirements:

- Experience with `React.js` or a willingness to learn.
- Knowledge of `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`.
- Experience with `Git` and `version control`.
- Ability to work independently and complete tasks on time.

## Things to focus on:

- Create custom, reusable components for the todo list application, including Button, Checkbox, and TodoRow:
  - __Button.tsx__
    Button will have two variants which are `big` and `small`

  - __Checkbox.tsx__
    Checkbox will have a checkbox input and a label. The label should be passed from props.

  - __TodoRow.tsx__
    This will contain the `Checkbox` and `Button` component. The button should only be visible on hover.

- Develop the final application using React.js and combine the reusable components to achieve the desired UI.
- Ensure that all code is properly structured and well documented.
- Create a Git repository and commit your work regularly with meaningful commit messages.
- Complete the project in a timely manner to be considered for the next interview round.

## What you can:

- You can use `create react app` or `next.js` for the assignment
- You can use Tailwind CSS or any other CSS framework to complete the assignment.

## What you cannot:

- You cannot copy code from the internet or use `GitHub Copilot`.
- You may not seek assistance from others, but you can use Google for minor help.

To apply, please submit your completed project in a GitHub repository along with your name, email, and repository URL via the Google form. We look forward to seeing your work and considering you for the next interview round!
